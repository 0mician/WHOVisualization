* WHOVisualization

** The dataset

The dataset can be found in the data folder of this project, it was downloaded from:

http://www.exploredata.net/Downloads

* Reproducibility

To enable users to reproduce the visualization, I have made all
sources available here, along with the raw data and its
processing. To avoid configuration specific issues, I am also
providing a vagrant configuration file.

Make sure that you use vagrant v 1.6 or above otherwise the
provisioning of the VM will not succeed.

Just clone this repo, and go vagrant up
